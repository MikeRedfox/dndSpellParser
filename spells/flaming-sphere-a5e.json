{"slug":"flaming-sphere-a5e","name":"Flaming Sphere","desc":"A 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire appears within range, lasting for the duration. It casts bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for another 20 feet, and ignites unattended flammable objects it touches.\n\nYou can use a bonus action to move the sphere up to 30 feet. It can jump over pits 10 feet wide or obstacles 5 feet tall. If you move the sphere into a creature, the sphere ends its movement for that turn and the creature makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere makes a Dexterity saving throw against the sphere's damage.","higher_level":"The damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.","range":"60 feet","components":"V, S, M","ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 1 minute","concentration":"yes","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":2}
