These plants rise up under your control as a grove swarm and act on your initiative. Although you are in a trance and deaf and blind with regard to your own senses, you see and hear through your grove swarm's senses. You can command your grove swarm telepathically, ordering it to advance, attack, or retreat. If the grove swarm enters your space, you can order it to carry you.\n\nIf you take any action other than continuing to concentrate on this spell, the spell ends and the trees and plants set down roots wherever they are currently located.","range":"120 feet","components":"V, S, M","ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 8 hours","concentration":"yes","casting_time":"1 hour","level_int":9}
