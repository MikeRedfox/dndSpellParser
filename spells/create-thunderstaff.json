{"slug":"create-thunderstaff","name":"Create Thunderstaff","desc":"After you cast **create thunderstaff** on a normal quarterstaff, the staff must then be mounted in a noisy location, such as a busy marketplace, and left there for 60 days. During that time, the staff gradually absorbs ambient sound.\n\nAfter 60 days, the staff is fully charged and canâ€™t absorb any more sound. At that point, it becomes a **thunderstaff**, a +1 quarterstaff that has 10 charges. When you hit on a melee attack with the staff and expend 1 charge, the target takes an extra 1d8 thunder damage. You can cast a [thunderwave](https://api.open5e.com/spells/thunderwave) spell from the staff as a bonus action by expending 2 charges. The staff cannot be recharged.\n\nIf the final charge is not expended within 60 days, the staff becomes nonmagical again.","range":"Touch","components":"V, S, M","material":"a quarterstaff","ritual":"no","duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":"no","casting_time":"10 minutes","level_int":7}
