{"slug":"mire","name":"Mire","desc":"When you cast mire, you create a 10-foot-diameter pit of quicksand, sticky mud, or a similar dangerous natural hazard suited to the region. A creature thatâ€™s in the area when the spell is cast or that enters the affected area must make a successful Strength saving throw or sink up to its waist and be restrained by the mire. From that point on, the mire acts as quicksand, but the DC for Strength checks to escape from the quicksand is equal to your spell save DC. A creature outside the mire trying to pull another creature free receives a +5 bonus on its Strength check.","range":"100 feet","components":"V, S, M","material":"a vial of sand mixed with water","ritual":"no","duration":"1 hour","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":3}
