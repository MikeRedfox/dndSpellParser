{"slug":"breeze-compass","name":"Breeze Compass","desc":"When you cast **breeze compass**, you must clearly imagine or mentally describe a location. It doesn’t need to be a location you’ve been to as long as you know it exists on the Material Plane. Within moments, a gentle breeze arises and blows along the most efficient path toward that destination. Only you can sense this breeze, and whenever it brings you to a decision point (a fork in a passageway, for example), you must make a successful DC 8 Intelligence (Arcana) check to deduce which way the breeze indicates you should go. On a failed check, the spell ends. The breeze guides you around cliffs, lava pools, and other natural obstacles, but it doesn’t avoid enemies or hostile creatures.","range":"Self","components":"V, S, M","material":"a magnetized needle","ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 1 hour","concentration":"yes","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":3}
