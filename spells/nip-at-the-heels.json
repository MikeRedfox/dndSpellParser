{"slug":"nip-at-the-heels","name":"Nip at the Heels","desc":"You create an illusory pack of wild dogs that bark and nip at one creature you can see within range, which must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls for the duration as it is distracted by the dogs. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. A target that is at least 10 feet off the ground (in a tree, flying, and so forth) has advantage on the saving throw, staying just out of reach of the jumping and barking dogs.\n","higher_level":"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.","range":"30 feet","components":"V, S, M","material":"a dogâ€™s tooth","ritual":"no","duration":"1 minute","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":2}
