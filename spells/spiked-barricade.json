{"slug":"spiked-barricade","name":"Spiked Barricade","desc":"With a word, you create a barricade of pointed, wooden poles, also known as a cheval de frise, to block your enemies' progress. The barricade is composed of six 5-foot cube barriers made of wooden spikes mounted on central, horizontal beams.\n  Each barrier doesn't need to be contiguous with another barrier, but each barrier must appear in an unoccupied space within range. Each barrier is difficult terrain, and a barrier provides half cover to a creature behind it. When a creature enters a barrier's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 3d6 piercing damage.\n  The barriers are objects made of wood that can be damaged and destroyed. Each barrier has AC 13, 20 hit points, and is vulnerable to bludgeoning and fire damage. Reducing a barrier to 0 hit points destroys it.\n  If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the barriers become permanent and can't be dispelled. Otherwise, the barriers disappear when the spell ends.","higher_level":"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the number of barriers you create increases by two for each slot level above 3rd.","range":"90 Feet","components":"V, M","ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 10 minutes","concentration":"yes","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":3}
