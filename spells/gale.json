{"slug":"gale","name":"Gale","desc":"You summon a storm to batter your oncoming enemies. Until the spell ends, freezing rain and turbulent winds fill a 20-foot-tall cylinder with a 300- foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. You must be outdoors to cast this spell. Moving to a place where you don't have a clear path to the sky ends the spell early.\n  The spell's area is heavily obscured, and exposed flames in the area are doused. The ground in the area becomes slick, difficult terrain, and a flying creature in the area must land at the end of its turn or fall. When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw as the wind and rain assail it. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d6 cold damage.\n  If a creature is concentrating in the spell's area, the creature must make a successful Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or lose concentration.","range":"1 mile","components":"V, S, M","ritual":"no","duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 minute","level_int":6}
