{"slug":"toxic-pollen","name":"Toxic Pollen","desc":"Upon casting this spell, one type of plant within range gains the ability to puff a cloud of pollen based on conditions you supply during casting. If the conditions are met, an affected plant sprays a pollen cloud in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on it. Creatures in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. At the end of a poisoned creature's turn, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, it is no longer poisoned. A plant can only release this pollen once within the duration.","range":"30 Feet","components":"V, S, M","ritual":"no","duration":"1 Year","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":2}
