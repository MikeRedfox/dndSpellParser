For the duration of the spell, you and whoever holds the other totem can communicate while either of you is in a beast shape. This isn’t a telepathic link; you simply understand each other’s verbal communication, similar to the effect of a speak with animals spell. This effect doesn’t allow a druid in beast shape to cast spells.\n","higher_level":"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can increase the number of target creatures by two for each slot level above 2nd. Each creature must receive a matching carved totem.","range":"Touch","components":"V, S, M","material":"two or more matching carved totems","ritual":"no","duration":"1 hour","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":2}
