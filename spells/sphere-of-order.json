Chaotic creatures that start their turn in the area or enter it on their turn take 5d8 psychic damage. The damage is 8d8 for Chaotic aberrations, celestials, elementals, and fiends. A successful Wisdom saving throw halves the damage, but Chaotic creatures (the only ones affected by the spell) make the saving throw with disadvantage.","range":"Self","components":"V, S","ritual":"no","duration":"1 Round","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":6}
