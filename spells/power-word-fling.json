The creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be thrown up to 15 feet vertically or horizontally. If the target impacts a surface, such as a ceiling or wall, it stops moving and takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage. If the target was thrown vertically, it plummets to the ground, taking falling damage as normal, unless it has a flying speed or other method of preventing a fall. If the target impacts a creature, the target stops moving and takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage, and the creature the target hits must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. After the target is thrown horizontally or it falls from being thrown vertically, regardless of whether it impacted a surface, it is knocked prone.\n  As a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns, you can attempt to fling the same creature again. The target must succeed on another Strength saving throw or be thrown.","higher_level":"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the distance you can fling the target increases by 5 feet, and the damage from impacting a surface or creature increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.","range":"30 Feet","components":"V","ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 1 minute","concentration":"yes","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":3}
