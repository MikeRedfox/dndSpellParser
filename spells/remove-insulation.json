{"slug":"remove-insulation","name":"Remove Insulation","desc":"You target a creature within range, and that creature must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw or become less resistant to lightning damage. A creature with immunity to lightning damage has advantage on this saving throw. On a failure, a creature with immunity to lightning damage instead has resistance to lightning damage for the spell's duration, and a creature with resistance to lightning damage loses its resistance for the duration. A creature without resistance to lightning damage that fails its saving throw takes double damage from lightning for the spell's duration. Remove curse or similar magic ends this spell.","higher_level":"If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration is 24 hours. If you use a spell slot of 8th level or higher, a creature with immunity to lightning damage no longer has advantage on its saving throw. If you use a spell slot of 9th level or higher, the spell lasts until it is dispelled.","range":"30 Feet","components":"V, S","ritual":"no","duration":"8 Hours","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":4}
