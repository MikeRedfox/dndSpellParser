To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn’t take an action this turn. |\n| 2-6 | The creature doesn’t move or take actions this turn. |\n| 7-8 | The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach.
