{"slug":"call-lightning-a5e","name":"Call Lightning","desc":"A 60-foot radius storm cloud that is 10 feet high appears in a space 100 feet above you. If there is not a point in the air above you that the storm cloud could appear, the spell fails (such as if you are in a small cavern or indoors).\n\nOn the round you cast it, and as an action on subsequent turns until the spell ends, you can call down a bolt of lightning to a point directly beneath the cloud. Each creature within 5 feet of the point makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.\n\nIf you are outdoors in a storm when you cast this spell, you take control of the storm instead of creating a new cloud and the spell's damage is increased by 1d10.","higher_level":"The damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.","range":"100 feet","components":"V, S","ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 10 minutes","concentration":"yes","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":3}
