{"slug":"ray-of-alchemical-negation","name":"Ray of Alchemical Negation","desc":"You launch a ray of blazing, polychromatic energy from your fingertips. Make a ranged spell attack against an alchemical item or a trap that uses alchemy to achieve its ends, such as a trap that sprays acid, releases poisonous gas, or triggers an explosion of alchemistâ€™s fire. A hit destroys the alchemical reagents, rendering them harmless. The attack is made against the most suitable object Armor Class.\n\nThis spell can also be used against a creature within range that is wholly or partially composed of acidic, poisonous, or alchemical components, such as an alchemical golem or an ochre jelly. In that case, a hit deals 6d6 force damage, and the target must make a successful Constitution saving throw or it deals only half as much damage with its acidic, poisonous, or alchemical attacks for 1 minute. A creature whose damage is halved can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.","range":"60 feet","components":"V, S","ritual":"no","duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":4}
