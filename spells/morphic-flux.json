{"slug":"morphic-flux","name":"Morphic Flux","desc":"When you cast this spell, your body becomes highly mutable, your flesh constantly shifting and quivering, occasionally growing extra parts-limbs and eyes-only to reabsorb them soon afterward. While under the effect of this spell, you have resistance to slashing and piercing damage and ignore the additional damage done by critical hits. You can squeeze through Tiny spaces without penalty. In addition, once per round, as a bonus action, you can make an unarmed attack with a newly- grown limb. Treat it as a standard unarmed attack, but you choose whether it does bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage.","range":"Self","components":"V, S, M","ritual":"no","duration":"1 Minute","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":7}
