You cannot wield weapons or hold objects, including material components, while under the effects of this spell.\n","higher_level":"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage you deal with your tentacle attack increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.","range":"10 feet","components":"V, S","ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 1 minute","concentration":"yes","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":1}
