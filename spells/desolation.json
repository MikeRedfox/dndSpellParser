{"slug":"desolation","name":"Desolation","desc":"You plant an obsidian acorn in solid ground and spend an hour chanting a litany of curses to the natural world, after which the land within 1 mile of the acorn becomes infertile, regardless of its previous state. Nothing will grow there, and all plant life in the area dies over the course of a day. Plant creatures are not affected. Spells that summon plants, such as [entangle](https://api.open5e.com/spells/entangle), require an ability check using the casterâ€™s spellcasting ability against your spell save DC. On a successful check, the spell functions normally; if the check fails, the spell is countered by **desolation**.\n\nAfter one year, the land slowly reverts to its normal fertility, unable to stave off the march of nature.\n\nA living creature that finishes a short rest within the area of a **desolation** spell halves the result of any Hit Dice it expends. Desolation counters the effects of a [bloom](https://api.open5e.com/spells/bloom) spell.\n\n***Ritual Focus.*** If you expend your ritual focus, the duration becomes permanent.","range":"Self","components":"V, S, M","material":"an obsidian acorn worth 500 gp, which is consumed in the casting","ritual":"yes","duration":"1 year","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 hour","level_int":8}
