{"slug":"pincer","name":"Pincer","desc":"You force your enemies into a tight spot. Choose two points you can see within range. The points must be at least 30 feet apart from each other. Each point then emits a thunderous boom in a 30-foot cone in the direction of the other point. The boom is audible out to 300 feet.\n  Each creature within a cone must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d10 thunder damage and is pushed up to 10 feet away from the point that emitted the cone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed. Objects that aren't being worn or carried within each cone are automatically pushed.","higher_level":"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 6th.","range":"120 Feet","components":"V, S","ritual":"no","duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":6}
