{"slug":"icy-grasp-of-the-void","name":"Icy Grasp of the Void","desc":"You summon the cold, inky darkness of the Void into being around a creature that you can see. The target takes 10d10 cold damage and is restrained for the duration; a successful Constitution saving throw halves the damage and negates the restrained condition. A restrained creature gains one level of exhaustion at the start of each of its turns. Creatures immune to cold and that do not breathe do not gain exhaustion. A creature restrained in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on a success.","range":"120 feet","components":"V, S","ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 1 minute","concentration":"yes","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":7}
