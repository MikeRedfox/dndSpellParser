Roll initiative for the ring servant, which acts on its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you donâ€™t issue any commands to the ring servant, it defends itself and you from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.","range":"Touch","components":"V, S, M","material":"two metal rings","ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 1 hour","concentration":"yes","casting_time":"1 minute","level_int":8}
