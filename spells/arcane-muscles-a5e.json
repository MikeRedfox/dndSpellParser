Until the spell ends, you can choose to use your spellcasting ability score for Athletics checks, and for the attack and damage rolls of unarmed strikes. In addition, your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage and count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.","range":"Self","components":"V, S","ritual":"no","duration":"1 minute","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 action"}
