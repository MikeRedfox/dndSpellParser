{"slug":"wind-walk-a5e","name":"Wind Walk","desc":"The targets assume a gaseous form and appear as wisps of cloud. Each target has a flying speed of 300 feet and resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons, but the only action it can take is the Dash action or to revert to its normal form (a process that takes 1 minute during which it is incapacitated and can't move).\n\nUntil the spell ends, a target can change again to cloud form (in an identical transformation process).\n\nWhen the effect ends for a target flying in cloud form, it descends 60 feet each round for up to 1 minute or until it safely lands. If the target can't land after 1 minute, the creature falls the rest of the way normally.","range":"30 feet","components":"V, S, M","ritual":"no","duration":"8 hours","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 minute","level_int":6}
