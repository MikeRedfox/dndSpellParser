The object’s hit points are reduced by a number equal to your level as a spellcaster, and Strength checks to shatter or break the object are made with advantage if they occur within 1 minute of the spell’s casting. If the object isn’t shattered during this time, it reverts to the state it was in before the spell was cast.","range":"Touch","components":"V, S, M","material":"an icicle","ritual":"no","duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":4}
