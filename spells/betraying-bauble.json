{"slug":"betraying-bauble","name":"Betraying Bauble","desc":"When you cast this spell, you touch a pair of objects. Each object must be small enough to fit in one hand. While holding one of the objects, you can sense the direction to the other object's location.\n  If the paired object is in motion, you know the direction and relative speed of its movement (walking, running, galloping, or similar). When the two objects are within 30 feet of each other, they vibrate faintly unless they are touching. If you aren't holding either item and the spell hasn't ended, you can sense the direction of the closest of the two objects within 1,000 feet of you, and you can sense if it is in motion. If neither object is within 1,000 feet of you, you sense the closest object as soon as you come within 1,000 feet of one of them. If an inch or more of lead blocks a direct path between you and an affected object, you can't sense that object.","range":"Touch","components":"V, S","ritual":"no","duration":"24 hours","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":2}
