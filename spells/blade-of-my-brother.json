The weapon enters that ally’s space and moves when the ally moves. If the weapon or the ally is forced to move more than 5 feet from the other, the spell ends.\n\nThe weapon acts on your turn by making an attack if a target presents itself. Its attack modifier equals your spellcasting level + the weapon’s inherent magical bonus, if any; it receives only its own inherent magical bonus to damage. The weapon fights for up to 4 rounds or until your concentration is broken, after which the spell ends and it falls to the ground.","range":"Touch","components":"V, S, M","material":"melee weapon owned by a dead ally of the target","ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 4 rounds","concentration":"yes","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":4}
