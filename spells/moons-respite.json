{"slug":"moons-respite","name":"Moon's Respite","desc":"You touch a creature who must be present for the entire casting. A beam of moonlight shines down from above, bathing the target in radiant light. The spell fails if you can't see the open sky. If the target has any levels of shadow corruption, the moonlight burns away some of the Shadow tainting it. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw against a DC of 10 + the number of shadow corruption levels it has. The creature takes 2d10 radiant damage per level of shadow corruption and removes 1 level of shadow corruption on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage and removes 2 levels of shadow corruption on a success.","range":"Touch","components":"V, S, M","ritual":"yes","duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 hour","level_int":5}
