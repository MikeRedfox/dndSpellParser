{"slug":"conjure-construct","name":"Conjure Construct","desc":"You summon a construct of challenge rating 5 or lower to harry your foes. It appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range. It disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.\n  The construct is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the construct, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to the construct, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.\n  If your concentration is broken, the construct doesn't disappear. Instead, you lose control of the construct, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled construct can't be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.\n  The construct deals double damage to objects and structures.\n  The GM has the construct's statistics.","higher_level":"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 6th.","range":"60 Feet","components":"V, M","ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 1 minute","concentration":"yes","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":6}
