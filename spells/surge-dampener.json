The protected creature can make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw to negate the effect of a chaos magic surge that does not normally allow a saving throw, or it gains advantage on a saving throw that is normally allowed. Once the protected creature makes a successful saving throw allowed by **surge dampener**, the spell ends.","range":"Touch","components":"V, S","ritual":"yes","duration":"1 minute, until expended","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":3}
