If the object is attended, you must succeed on a melee spell attack roll against the creature holding or controlling the object. Any effect that affects the original object also affects the duplicate (charges spent, damage taken, etc.) and any effect that affects the duplicate also affects the original object. If either object is destroyed, both are destroyed.
