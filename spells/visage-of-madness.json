{"slug":"visage-of-madness","name":"Visage of Madness","desc":"When you cast this spell, your face momentarily becomes that of a demon lord, frightful enough to drive enemies mad. Every foe that’s within 30 feet of you and that can see you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature claws savagely at its eyes, dealing piercing damage to itself equal to 1d6 + the creature’s Strength modifier. The creature is also stunned until the end of its next turn and blinded for 1d4 rounds. A creature that rolls maximum damage against itself (a 6 on the d6) is blinded permanently.","range":"Self","components":"V, S","ritual":"no","duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":4}
