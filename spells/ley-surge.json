{"slug":"ley-surge","name":"Ley Surge","desc":"You unleash the power of a ley line within 5 miles, releasing a spark that flares into a 30-foot sphere centered around a point within 150 feet of you. Each creature in the sphere takes 14d6 force damage and is stunned for 1 minute; a successful Constitution saving throw halves the damage and negates the stun. A stunned creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success. Special. A geomancer with a bound ley line can cast this spell as long as he or she is on the same plane as the bound line.","range":"150 Feet","components":"V, S","ritual":"no","duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":9}
