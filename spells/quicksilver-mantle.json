{"slug":"quicksilver-mantle","name":"Quicksilver Mantle","desc":"You transform an ordinary cloak into a highly reflective, silvery garment. This mantle increases your AC by 2 and grants advantage on saving throws against gaze attacks. In addition, whenever you are struck by a ray such as a [ray of enfeeblement](https://api.open5e.com/spells/ray-of-enfeeblement), [scorching ray](https://api.open5e.com/spells/scorching-ray), or even [disintegrate](https://api.open5e.com/spells/disintegrate), roll 1d4. On a result of 4, the cloak deflects the ray, which instead strikes a randomly selected target within 10 feet of you. The cloak deflects only the first ray that strikes it each round; rays after the first affect you as normal.","range":"Self","components":"V, S, M","material":"a nonmagical cloak and a dram of quicksilver worth 10 gp","ritual":"no","duration":"1 hour","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":4}
