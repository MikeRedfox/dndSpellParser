{"slug":"dark-dementing","name":"Dark Dementing","desc":"A dark shadow creeps across the target’s mind and leaves a small bit of shadow essence behind, triggering a profound fear of the dark. A creature you designate within range must make a Charisma saving throw. If it fails, the target becomes frightened of you for the duration. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw each time it takes damage, ending the effect on a success. While frightened in this way, the creature will not willingly enter or attack into a space that isn’t brightly lit. If it’s in dim light or darkness, the creature must either move toward bright light or create its own (by lighting a lantern, casting a [light](https://api.open5e.com/spells/light) spell, or the like).","range":"120 feet","components":"V, S, M","material":"a moonstone","ritual":"no","duration":"10 minutes","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":5}
