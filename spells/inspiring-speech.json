{"slug":"inspiring-speech","name":"Inspiring Speech","desc":"The verbal component of this spell is a 10-minute-long, rousing speech. At the end of the speech, all your allies within the affected area who heard the speech gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and advantage on saving throws for 1 hour against effects that cause the charmed or frightened condition. Additionally, each recipient gains temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. If you move farther than 1 mile from your allies or you die, this spell ends. A character can be affected by only one casting of this spell at a time; subsequent, overlapping castings have no additional effect and don't extend the spell's duration.","range":"60 Feet","components":"V","ritual":"no","duration":"1 hour","concentration":"no","casting_time":"10 minutes","level_int":4}
