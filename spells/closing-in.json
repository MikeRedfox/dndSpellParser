The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, which it makes with disadvantage if itâ€™s in an enclosed space.

An affected creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n","higher_level":"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.","range":"30 feet","components":"V, S","ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 1 minute","concentration":"yes","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":3}
