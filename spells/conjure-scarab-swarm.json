Two swarms of insects (beetles) appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within range.\n\nEach swarm disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The swarms are friendly to you and your allies. Make one initiative roll for both swarms, which have their own turns. They obey verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you donâ€™t issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures but otherwise take no actions.","range":"60 feet","components":"V, S, M","material":"a beetle carapace","ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 10 minutes","concentration":"yes","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":2}
