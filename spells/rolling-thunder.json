{"slug":"rolling-thunder","name":"Rolling Thunder","desc":"A tremendous bell note explodes from your outstretched hand and rolls forward in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be deafened for 1 minute. A creature made of material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on its saving throw against this spell.\n\nWhile a creature is deafened in this way, it is wreathed in thundering energy; it takes 2d8 thunder damage at the start of its turn, and its speed is halved. A deafened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n","higher_level":"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.","range":"Self (30-foot line)","components":"V, S, M","material":"a sliver of metal from a gong","ritual":"no","duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":2}
