{"slug":"maze-a5e","name":"Maze","desc":"The target is banished to a complex maze on its own demiplane, and remains there for the duration or until the target succeeds in escaping.\n\nThe target can use an action to attempt to escape, making an Intelligence saving throw. On a successful save it escapes and the spell ends. A creature with Labyrinthine Recall (or a similar trait) automatically succeeds on its save.\n\nWhen the spell ends the target reappears in the space it occupied before the spell was cast, or the closest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.","range":"60 feet","components":"V, S","ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 10 minutes","concentration":"yes","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":8}
