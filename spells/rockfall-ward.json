{"slug":"rockfall-ward","name":"Rockfall Ward","desc":"You temporarily halt the fall of up to a 10-foot cube of nonmagical objects or debris, saving those who might have been crushed. The falling material's rate of descent slows to 60 feet per round and comes to a stop 5 feet above the ground, where it hovers until the spell ends. This spell can't prevent missile weapons from striking a target, and it can't slow the descent of an object larger than a 10-foot cube. However, at the GM's discretion, it can slow the descent of a section of a larger object, such as the wall of a falling building or a section of sail and rigging tied to a falling mast.","higher_level":"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the cube of debris and objects you can halt increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 1st.","range":"120 Feet","components":"V, S","ritual":"no","duration":"1 minute","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 reaction, which you take when nonmagical debris fall within 120 feet of you","level_int":1}
