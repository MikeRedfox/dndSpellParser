{"slug":"teleportation-circle-a5e","name":"Teleportation Circle","desc":"You draw a 10-foot diameter circle on the ground and open within it a shimmering portal to a permanent teleportation circle elsewhere in the world. The portal remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly travels to the destination circle.\n\nPermanent teleportation circles are commonly found within major temples, guilds, and other important locations. Each circle has a unique sequence of magical runes inscribed in a certain pattern called a sigil sequence.\n\nWhen you cast teleportation circle, you inscribe runes that match the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle you know. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for 2 destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the Narrator. You can learn a new sigil sequence with 1 minute of observation and study.\n\nCasting the spell in the same location every day for a year creates a permanent teleportation circle with its own unique sigil sequence. You do not need to teleport when casting the spell to make a permanent destination.","range":"touch","components":"V, M","ritual":"no","duration":"1 round","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 minute","level_int":5}
