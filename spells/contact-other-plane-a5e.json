On a failure, you take 6d6 psychic damage and suffer four levels of strife until you finish a long rest. A _greater restoration_ spell ends this effect.\n\nOn a successful save, you can ask the entity up to 5 questions before the spell ends. When possible the entity responds with one-word answers: yes, no, maybe, never, irrelevant, or unclear. At the Narrator's discretion, it may instead provide a brief but truthful answer when necessary.","range":"self","components":"V","ritual":"yes","duration":"1 minute","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 minute","level_int":5}
