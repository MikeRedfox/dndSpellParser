If another creature is holding the item when the stone is crushed, the item is not summoned to you. Instead, the spell grants you the knowledge of who possesses it and a general idea of the creature's location.\n\nEach time you cast this spell, you must use a different precious stone.\n\nDispel magic or a similar effect targeting the stone ends the spell.","range":"touch","components":"V, S, M","ritual":"yes","duration":"Permanent","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 minute","level_int":6}
