{"slug":"clone-a5e","name":"Clone","desc":"This spell grows a duplicate of the target that remains inert indefinitely as long as its vessel is sealed.\n\nThe clone grows inside the sealed vessel and matures over the course of 120 days. You can choose to have the clone be a younger version of the target.\n\nOnce the clone has matured, when the target dies its soul is transferred to the clone so long as it is free and willing. The clone is identical to the target (except perhaps in age) and has the same personality, memories, and abilities, but it is without the target's equipment. The target's original body cannot be brought back to life by magic since its soul now resides within the cloned body.","range":"touch","components":"V, S, M","ritual":"no","duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 hour","level_int":8}
