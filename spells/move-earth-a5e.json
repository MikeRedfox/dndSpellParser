{"slug":"move-earth-a5e","name":"Move Earth","desc":"You reshape the area, changing its elevation or creating and eliminating holes, walls, and pillars.\n\nThe only limitation is that the elevation change may not exceed half the area's horizontal dimensions.\n\nFor example, affecting a 40-by-40 area allows you to include 20 foot high pillars, holes 20 feet deep, and changes in terrain elevation of 20 feet or less.\n\nChanges that result in unstable terrain are subject to collapse.\n\nChanges take 10 minutes to complete, after which you can choose another area to affect. Due to the slow speed of transformation, it is nearly impossible for creatures to be hurt or captured by the spell.\n\nThis spell has no effect on stone, objects crafted from stone, or plants, though these objects will shift based on changes in the area.","range":"120 feet","components":"V, S, M","ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 2 hours","concentration":"yes","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":6}
