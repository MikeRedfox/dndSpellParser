With a sharp word, you create a 30-foot-radius cylinder of night centered on a point on the ground within range.

Creatures inside the darkened cylinder can see illuminated areas outside the cylinder normally.","range":"100 feet","components":"V, S","ritual":"yes","duration":"Up to 10 minutes","concentration":"yes","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":3}
