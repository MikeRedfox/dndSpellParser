{"slug":"lightless-torch","name":"Lightless Torch","desc":"You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. Until the spell ends, the object sheds a shadowy miasma in a 30-foot radius. A creature with darkvision inside the radius sees the area as if it were filled with bright light. The miasma doesn't shed light, and a creature with darkvision inside the radius can still see outside the radius as normal. A creature with darkvision outside the radius or a creature without darkvision sees only that the object is surrounded by wisps of shadow.\n  Completely covering the affected object with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the effect. Though the effect doesn't shed light, it can be dispelled if the area of a darkness spell overlaps the area of this spell.\n  If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell.","higher_level":"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the duration increases by 2 hours for each slot level above 1st.","range":"Touch","components":"V, S","ritual":"no","duration":"1 hour","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":1}
