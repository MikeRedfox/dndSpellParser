{"slug":"daggerhawk","name":"Daggerhawk","desc":"When **daggerhawk** is cast on a nonmagical dagger, a ghostly hawk appears around the weapon. The hawk and dagger fly into the air and make a melee attack against one creature you select within 60 feet, using your spell attack modifier and dealing piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Intelligence modifier on a hit. On your subsequent turns, you can use an action to cause the daggerhawk to attack the same target. The daggerhawk has AC 14 and, although it’s invulnerable to all damage, a successful attack against it that deals bludgeoning, force, or slashing damage sends the daggerhawk tumbling, so it can’t attack again until after your next turn.","range":"Self","components":"V, S, M","material":"a dagger","ritual":"no","duration":"1 minute","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":2}
