{"slug":"doom-of-disenchantment","name":"Doom of Disenchantment","desc":"When you cast **doom of disenchantment**, your armor and shield glow with light. When a creature hits you with an attack, the spell counters any magic that provides the attack with a bonus to hit or to damage. For example, a +1 weapon would still be considered magical, but it gets neither +1 to hit nor +1 to damage on any attack against you.\n\nThe spell also suppresses other magical properties of the attack. A [sword of wounding](https://api.open5e.com/magicitems/sword-of-wounding), for example, can’t cause ongoing wounds on you, and you recover hit points lost to the weapon's damage normally. If the attack was a spell, it’s affected as if you had cast [counterspell](https://api.open5e.com/spells/counterspell), using Charisma as your spellcasting ability. Spells with a duration of instantaneous, however, are unaffected.","range":"Self","components":"V, S","ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 5 rounds","concentration":"yes","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":3}
