{"slug":"living-shadows","name":"Living Shadows","desc":"You whisper sibilant words of void speech that cause shadows to writhe with unholy life. Choose a point you can see within range. Writhing shadows spread out in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on that point, grasping at creatures in the area. A creature that starts its turn in the area or that enters the area for the first time on its turn must make a successful Strength saving throw or be restrained by the shadows. A creature that starts its turn restrained by the shadows must make a successful Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion.\n\nA restrained creature can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.","range":"120 feet","components":"V, S","ritual":"no","duration":"1 minute","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":5}
