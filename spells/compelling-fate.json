If the target fails a Charisma saving throw, you can predict that creature’s actions. This has the following effects:\n* You have advantage on attack rolls against the target.\n* For every 5 feet the target moves, you can move 5 feet (up to your normal movement) on the target’s turn when it has completed its movement. This is deducted from your next turn’s movement.\n* As a reaction at the start of the target’s turn, you can warn yourself and allies that can hear you of the target’s offensive intentions; any creature targeted by the target’s next attack gains a +2 bonus to AC or to its saving throw against that attack.\n","higher_level":"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is extended by 1 round for each slot level above 3rd.","range":"30 feet","components":"V, M","material":"a sprinkling of silver dust worth 20 gp","ritual":"no","duration":"1 round","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":3}
