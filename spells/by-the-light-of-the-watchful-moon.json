{"slug":"by-the-light-of-the-watchful-moon","name":"By the Light of the Watchful Moon","desc":"Regardless of the time of day or your location, you command the watchful gaze of the moon to illuminate threats to you and your allies. Shafts of bright moonlight, each 5 feet wide, shine down from the sky (or from the ceiling if you are indoors), illuminating all spaces within range that contain threats, whether they are enemies, traps, or hidden hazards. An enemy creature that makes a successful Charisma saving throw resists the effect and is not picked out by the moon’s glow.\n\nThe glow does not make invisible creatures visible, but it does indicate an invisible creature’s general location (somewhere within the 5-foot beam). The light continues to illuminate any target that moves, but a target that moves out of the spell’s area is no longer illuminated. A threat that enters the area after the spell is cast is not subject to the spell’s effect.","range":"90 feet","components":"V, S","ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 1 minute","concentration":"yes","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":4}
