{"slug":"instant-fortification","name":"Instant Fortification","desc":"Through this spell, you transform a miniature statuette of a keep into an actual fort. The fortification springs from the ground in an unoccupied space within range. It is a 10- foot cube (including floor and roof).\n\nEach wall has two arrow slits. One wall also includes a metal door with an [arcane lock](https://api.open5e.com/spells/arcane-lock) effect on it. You designate at the time of the fortâ€™s creation which creatures can ignore the lock and enter the fortification. The door has AC 20 and 60 hit points, and it can be broken open with a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check. The walls are made of stone (AC 15) and are immune to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. Each 5-foot-square section of wall has 90 hit points. Reducing a section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it, allowing access to the inside of the fortification.\n","higher_level":"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can increase the length or width of the fortification by 5 feet for each slot level above 5th. You can make a different choice (width or length) for each slot level above 5th.","range":"60 feet","components":"V, S, M","material":"a statuette of a keep worth 250 gp, which is consumed in the casting","ritual":"yes","duration":"Permanent","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":5}
