The Narrator chooses from the following:\n\n* Fortunate omen (good results)\n* Calamity omen (bad results)\n* Ambivalence omen (both good and bad results)\n* No omen (results that aren't especially good or bad)\n\nThis omen does not account for possible circumstances that could change the outcome, such as making additional preparations.\n\nWhen you cast this spell again before finishing a long rest, the chance of getting a random reading from the above options increases.
