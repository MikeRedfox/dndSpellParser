{"slug":"black-sunshine","name":"Black Sunshine","desc":"You hold up a flawed pearl and it disappears, leaving behind a magic orb in your hand that pulses with dim purple light. Allies that you designate become invisible if they're within 60 feet of you and if light from the orb can reach the space they occupy. An invisible creature still casts a faint, purple shadow.\n\nThe orb can be used as a thrown weapon to attack an enemy. On a hit, the orb explodes in a flash of light and the spell ends. The targeted enemy and each creature within 10 feet of it must make a successful Dexterity saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature blinded in this way repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.","range":"Self (60-foot radius)","components":"V, M","material":"a discolored pearl, which the spell consumes","ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 1 minute","concentration":"yes","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":8}
