{"slug":"molechs-blessing","name":"Molech's Blessing","desc":"Deep Magic: clockwork ritual You call upon the dark blessings of the furnace god Molech. In an hour-long ritual begun at midnight, you dedicate a living being to Molech by branding the deity's symbol onto the victim's forehead. If the ritual is completed and the victim fails to make a successful Wisdom saving throw (or the victim chooses not to make one), the being is transformed into an avatar of Molech under your control. The avatar is 8 feet tall and appears to be made of black iron wreathed in flames. Its eyes, mouth, and a portion of its torso are cut away to show the churning fire inside that crackles with wailing voices. The avatar has all the statistics and abilities of an earth elemental, with the following differences: Alignment is Neutral Evil; Speed is 50 feet and it cannot burrow or use earth glide; it gains the fire form ability of a fire elemental, but it cannot squeeze through small spaces; its Slam does an additional 1d10 fire damage. This transformation lasts for 24 hours. At the end of that time, the subject returns to its normal state and takes 77 (14d10) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw.","range":"Touch","components":"V, S, M","ritual":"no","duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 hour","level_int":7}
