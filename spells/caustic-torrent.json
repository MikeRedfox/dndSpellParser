{"slug":"caustic-torrent","name":"Caustic Torrent","desc":"A swirling jet of acid sprays from you in a direction you choose. The acid fills a line 60 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line takes 14d6 acid damage, or half as much damage if it makes a successful Dexterity saving throw. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this spell is killed, and its body is liquefied. In addition, each creature other than you that’s in the line or within 5 feet of it is poisoned for 1 minute by toxic fumes. Creatures that don’t breathe or that are immune to acid damage aren’t poisoned. A poisoned creature can repeat the Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.","range":"Self (60-foot line)","components":"V, S, M","material":"a chip of bone pitted by acid","ritual":"no","duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":8}
