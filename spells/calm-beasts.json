Each beast in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must make a Charisma saving throw. If a creature fails its saving throw, choose one of the following two effects.\n  ***Suppress Hold.*** You can suppress any effect causing the target to be charmed or frightened. When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.\n  ***Suppress Hostility.*** You can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its allies being harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the GM rules otherwise.","range":"60 Feet","components":"V, S","ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 1 minute","concentration":"yes","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":2}
