You and each creature in the area that you choose to affect take on the appearance of a harmless creature or object, chosen by you. Each image is identical, and only appearance is affected.

If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, that creature sees through the image.","range":"Self (20-foot radius)","components":"V, S, M","material":"a paper ring","ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 10 minutes","concentration":"yes","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":3}
