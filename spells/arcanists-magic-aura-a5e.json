When cast upon the same target with the same effect for 30 successive days, it lasts until it is dispelled.\n\n* **False Aura:** A magical target appears nonmagical, a nonmagical target appears magical, or you change a target's magical aura so that it appears to belong to a school of magic of your choosing.
