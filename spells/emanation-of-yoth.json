{"slug":"emanation-of-yoth","name":"Emanation of Yoth","desc":"You call forth a [ghost](https://api.open5e.com/monsters/ghost)// that takes the form of a spectral, serpentlike assassin. It appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The ghost disappears when it’s reduced to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.\n\nThe ghost is friendly to you and your companions for the duration of the spell. Roll initiative for the ghost, which takes its own turns. It obeys verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue a command to it, the ghost defends itself from hostile creatures but doesn’t move or take other actions.\n\nYou are immune to the ghost’s Horrifying Visage action but can willingly become the target of the ghost’s Possession ability. You can end this effect on yourself as a bonus action.\n","higher_level":"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th or 7th level, you call forth two ghosts.
