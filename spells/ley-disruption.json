{"slug":"ley-disruption","name":"Ley Disruption","desc":"You create a 15-foot-radius sphere filled with disruptive ley energy. The sphere is centered around a point you can see within range. Surfaces inside the sphere shift erratically, becoming difficult terrain for the duration. Any creature in the area when it appears, that starts its turn in the area, or that enters the area for the first time on a turn must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. If you cast this spell in an area within the influence of a ley line, creatures have disadvantage on their saving throws against its effect. Special. A geomancer with a bound ley line is “within the influence of a ley line” for purposes of ley disruption as long as he or she is on the same plane as the bound line.","range":"50 Feet","components":"V, S, M","ritual":"no","duration":"1 Minute","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":2}
