Whenever a creature starts its turn inside the cube or within 5 feet of it, or enters the cube for the first time on its turn, the conjured shades make an attack using your melee spell attack modifier; on a hit, the target takes 3d8 necrotic damage. The space inside the cube is difficult terrain.","range":"60 feet","components":"V, S, M","material":"a toy soldier","ritual":"no","duration":"Up to 1 minute","concentration":"yes","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":3}
