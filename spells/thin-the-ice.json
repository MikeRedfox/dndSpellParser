{"slug":"thin-the-ice","name":"Thin the Ice","desc":"You target a point within range. That point becomes the top center of a cylinder 10 feet in radius and 40 feet deep. All ice inside that area melts immediately. The uppermost layer of ice seems to remain intact and sturdy, but it covers a 40-foot-deep pit filled with ice water. A successful Wisdom (Survival) check or passive Perception check against your spell save DC notices the thin ice. If a creature weighing more than 20 pounds (or a greater weight specified by you when casting the spell) treads over the cylinder or is already standing on it, the ice gives way. Unless the creature makes a successful Dexterity saving throw, it falls into the icy water, taking 2d6 cold damage plus whatever other problems are caused by water, by armor, or by being drenched in a freezing environment. The water gradually refreezes normally.","range":"60 feet","components":"V, S, M","material":"a piece of sunstone","ritual":"no","duration":"Instantaneous","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":1}
