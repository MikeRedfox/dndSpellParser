If an affected creature makes any of the above rolls against a non-target, it takes a -2 penalty on that roll.\n","higher_level":"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration increases by 1 round for each slot level above 2nd.","range":"100 feet","components":"V, S","ritual":"no","duration":"1 round","concentration":"no","casting_time":"1 action","level_int":2}
