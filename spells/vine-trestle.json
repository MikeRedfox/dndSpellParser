{"slug":"vine-trestle","name":"Vine Trestle","desc":"You cause a vine to sprout from the ground and crawl across a surface or rise into the air in a direction chosen by you. The vine must sprout from a solid surface (such as the ground or a wall), and it is strong enough to support 600 pounds of weight along its entire length. The vine collapses immediately if that 600-pound limit is exceeded. A vine that collapses from weight or damage instantly disintegrates.\n\nThe vine has many small shoots, so it can be climbed with a successful DC 5 Strength (Athletics) check. It has AC 8, hit points equal to 5 Ã— your spellcasting level, and a damage threshold of 5.\n","higher_level":"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the vine can support an additional 30 pounds, and its damage threshold increases by 1 for each slot level above 2nd.\n\n***Ritual Focus.*** If you expend your ritual focus, the vine is permanent until destroyed or dispelled.","range":"30 feet","components":"V, S, M","material":"a 1-inch piece of green vine that is consumed in the casting","ritual":"yes","duration":"1 hour","concentration":"no","casting_time":"10 minutes","level_int":2}
